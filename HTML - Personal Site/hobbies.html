            <p>I have a MILLION things I like to do, but the main ones are:</p>
            <table>

            <p>I'm currently training for the Osaka Marathon in 2023 so I like to spend my free time when not coding on running and doing calisthenics. 
                I believe both body and mind are like the sword, and by pushing ourselves we can sharpen our blades. By having so many different
                interests, I am able to explore the world from many different lenses. I think that is essential to broadening the mind and keeping
                the brain from stagnating. What are you into?</p>
